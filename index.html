<h1>Hello.</h1>
<p style="font-weight: 500; font-size: 2.2em">My name is Jimmy.</p>
</body>
<p>
  I am second year Computer Science and Mathematics student at UNSW. 
  Unforunately I am still 18 and play <a>League of Legends</a>. 
  Also a certified <a>DataSoc enjoyer</a>.
</p>
<p>
  I peaked in <a>Comp1511</a> tbh, all my grades have been going down after T1.
  It's been pretty hard to learn how to make a website too in one night but
  that's why they invented <a>ChatGPT</a>.
</p>
<p>
  I hope this website is good enough. Ty <bea>:-)</bea>
